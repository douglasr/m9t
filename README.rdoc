== m9t - Various units of measurement

This package handles the basic units of measure:
* distance,
* direction,
* speed,
* temperature,
* weight.

The emphasis is on:
* coherent interface,
* ease of translation (using i18n).

== Other Software

* ruby-units
  * Doesn't handle i18n:
    * The library depends heavily on English string representations of units.
  * Monkey patches a lot of core classes:
    * Adds methods to e.g. Object.
